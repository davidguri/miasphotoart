# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

To run, first execute the command `npm install -g bun`, then when that's done, run `bun install` and after that, run `bun run dev`.

To get the production version, execute the command `bun run build`, and copy the files from the dist folder into your hosting service.
